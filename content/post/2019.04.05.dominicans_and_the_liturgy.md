On April 5, 2019, I had the opportunity to coorganize a colloquium on *Dominicans and the Liturgy in Medieval Paris* together with Susan Boynton of Columbia University. The conference took place at Reid Hall in Paris, and included presentations on various aspects of Dominican liturgy by scholars based in Ireland, Italy, France, Germany, and the United States.
