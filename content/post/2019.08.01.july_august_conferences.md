In July and August 2019, I did a long conference circuit in England and the United States. In the first week of July, I participated for the first time at the International Medieval Congress in Leeds, giving a presentation on "Musical Notation in Medieval Bible Missals" in which I spoke about three manuscripts I'm working on for my dissertation which include musical notation. I enjoyed meeting many other scholars and hearing various presentations, in addition to getting to know the Cathedral of St. Anne Community and even being interviewed for Humans of Leeds! During my time in Leeds I also had a chance to visit one of my Bible Missals in nearby Sheffield and also to see York Minster.

Later in the month, I flew to the United States to participate in *Quidam enim dicunt: Mendicant Theologies before Aquinas and Bonaventure*, a conference sponsored by The Franciscan Institute at St. Bonaventure University. I gave a presentation on "Bible Missals and Early Dominican and Franciscan Theology," looking at a selection of Franciscan and Dominican Bible Missals and comparing their contents with the liturgical citations of medieval Franciscan and Dominican theologians.

After an additional week visiting friends and family, I returned to England to participate in the 27th Congress of *Societas Liturgica* in Durham, where I gave a presentation on "Abbreviation, Memory, and the Celebration of the Liturgy," giving an overview of the medieval practice of abbreviation and suggesting that a careful study of abbreviations in liturgical books can tell us important information about what the users of such books were expected to know by heart in order to use the book. I enjoyed the chance to spend almost a week under the shadow of the great cathedral of Durham, and to even have a solemn celebration of the feast of St. Dominic with three other Dominican friars and sisters who were participating in the conference, as well as other participants who joined us for the St. Dominic liturgy. A highlight of the conference was visiting the monastery of Lindisfarne during a conference outing.
