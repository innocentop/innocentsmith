I'm happy to share a [PDF](https://innocentsmith.info/publication/smith-divine-2018/smith-divine-2018.pdf) of a newly published article from *Sacred Music* on [The Divine Office and Dominican Life](https://innocentsmith.info/publication/smith-divine-2018/smith-divine-2018.pdf). The article derives from a talk I gave a few years ago to the [Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia](https://www.nashvilledominican.org/) in Nashville, TN. Some aspects of it are focused on particularities of their form of Dominican life, but I hope it might be helpful for other Dominicans and also for anyone who prays the Divine Office.
