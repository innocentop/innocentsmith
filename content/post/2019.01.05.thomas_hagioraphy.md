Later this month, I will be taking part in a conference in Rome, the third [Cantieri dell’Agiografia](http://www.aisscaweb.it/it/cantieri-agiografia/) organized by the Associazione italiana per lo studio della santità, dei culti e dell'agiografia (AISSCA). The full schedule for the conference is available [here](http://www.aisscaweb.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Programma-Cantieri-dellAgiografia-III-edizione-2019-.pdf). I have organized a session on St. Thomas Aquinas and Hagiography.

In addition to utilizing biblical, theological and philosophical sources, the 13th century Dominican theologian St. Thomas Aquinas made significant appeals to the lives of the saints throughout his writings. Although his brother Dominicans John of Mailly, Bartholomew of Trent, and James of Voragine may be better known today for their hagiographical writings, Thomas’s writings reveal a keen interest in both the lives of the saints in themselves and their significance as monuments to Christian belief and practice. In this session, we will consider the hagiographical sources and writings of Thomas Aquinas from the perspectives of systematic, historical, moral, and liturgical theology, considering his treatment of saints from the New Testament period as well as early Christian saints and martyrs. Through this panel, we hope to demonstrate the significance of Thomas Aquinas as hagiographer and to show the fruitfulness of multi-disciplinary inquiry into the treatment of saints by authors beyond the recognized canon of hagiographical writers.
