# Biography

Innocent Smith, op is a doctoral student in Liturgical Studies at the Universität Regensburg. His research interests are situated at the intersection of liturgy and theology, including focuses on medieval liturgical manuscripts, scholastic theology, ecclesiology, and sacred music. He is a member of the Order of Preachers (Dominican Friars) and is a Catholic priest. He is presently assigned to the Priory of St. Kajetan in Munich, Germany.

Smith's doctoral dissertation, "Doers of the Word: Bible Missals and the Celebration of the Eucharist in the 13th Century," focuses on a set of manuscript bibles which contain liturgical texts for the celebration of the Mass. Although these manuscripts have only recently begun to receive scholarly attention, the liturgical selections contained in bible missals give precious insight into both the development of medieval liturgical traditions as well as the processes of customization and design of medieval bibles. For medieval Christians, scripture was not only to be read, but also enacted: “Do this in memory of me.” The 13th century bible missal presents a fascinating example of the interpenetration of memory and enactment, enabling the celebration of the mysteries articulated in the biblical text, allowing medieval readers to be “doers of the word, and not hearers only” (James 1:22).
