# Biography

Innocent Smith, op is Assistant Professor of Homiletics at [St. Mary's Seminary & University](http://www.stmarys.edu/). His research interests are at the intersection of liturgy and theology, including sacramental theology, homiletics, liturgical manuscripts, ecclesiology, and sacred music. He is a Roman Catholic priest and a member of [Province of St. Joseph](https://opeast.org/) of the [Order of Preachers](https://www.op.org). He is presently assigned to the Dominican community of Sts. Philip and James in Baltimore, MD.

Smith's forthcoming monograph, "Bible Missals and the Dominican Liturgy," focuses on medieval bibles which contain liturgical texts for the celebration of the Mass. The liturgical selections contained in bible missals give precious insight into both the development of the celebration of the liturgy as well as the processes of customization and design of medieval bibles. Bible missals present a fascinating example of the interpenetration of memory and enactment, enabling the celebration of the mysteries articulated in the biblical text.
